# Project Progress Log

## Legacy Go Prototype (Pre-July 2025)

-   **Summary:** The initial Go-based implementation successfully established the core concepts of the project. Key achievements included resolving complex LLM streaming and tool-calling issues, designing an interrupt mechanism for user interaction, and laying the groundwork for future development. This prototype served as a valuable proof-of-concept before the strategic pivot to a more dynamic tech stack.

## Phase 1: Migration & Core Architecture (Early July 2025)

### 2025-07-02: Technology Stack Migration to TypeScript & LangGraph

-   **Milestone:** Successfully migrated the project from Go to a TypeScript-based monorepo.
-   **Details:** Initialized the project with `npm` and integrated core dependencies, including `langchain` and `langgraph`, marking a fundamental shift in the project's technical direction.

### 2025-07-02: Dynamic Tool Integration Architecture

-   **Milestone:** Architected and implemented a dynamic system for integrating MCP (Model-as-a-Service Communication Protocol) tools with the LangGraph agent.
-   **Details:**
    -   Decoupled agent logic from the communication protocol, a pattern documented in `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`.
    -   Implemented a mock `McpClientManager` and a dynamic tool generator (`src/mcp/`).
    -   Converted the application into a fully interactive command-line tool using Node.js's `readline` module.

## Phase 2: Stabilization & Feature Enhancement (Early-Mid July 2025)

### 2025-07-03: System Stabilization and UX Improvements

-   **Milestone:** Achieved a stable, feature-rich application by resolving critical bugs and enhancing the user experience.
-   **Key Fixes & Features:**
    -   **API Authentication:** Resolved a `401 Authentication Fails` error by ensuring the `apiKey` was correctly passed during model initialization (`src/agents/orchestrator.ts`).
    -   **Configuration Cleanup:** Corrected the `package.json` to align with the project's `npm` package manager.
    -   **"Typewriter" Streaming:** Implemented true "typewriter" style streaming for model responses in `src/index.ts`, significantly improving the interactive feel.
    -   **DeepSeek Reasoner Stream:** Enabled the `deepseek-reasoner` model's "thinking" process stream by correctly configuring the `reasoning: {}` parameter in `src/agents/orchestrator.ts`.

### 2025-07-04: Enhanced Reliability with Zod Validation

-   **Milestone:** Increased application robustness by integrating Zod for schema validation.
-   **Details:** Implemented strict input, tool call, and output state validation within the Orchestrator agent, catching potential data errors early without compromising existing functionality.

## Phase 3: Advanced Agent Capabilities (Mid July 2025)

### 2025-07-04: Interactive Multi-Turn Conversations

-   **Milestone:** Re-architected the core graph (`src/graph.ts`) to support interactive, multi-turn conversations with specialist agents.
-   **Architectural Shift:**
    -   Moved from a rigid, single-action dispatch model to a flexible "interactive subgraph" pattern.
    -   Agents now manage their own internal state and use conditional routing to decide whether to continue a conversation or return control to the orchestrator.
-   **Impact:** This major enhancement allows the system to handle complex, multi-step tasks that require follow-up questions and user clarification, making the agents significantly more capable and autonomous.
