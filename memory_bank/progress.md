# Project Progress Log

## Legacy Go Prototype (Pre-July 2025)

-   **Summary:** The initial Go-based implementation successfully established the core concepts of the project. Key achievements included resolving complex LLM streaming and tool-calling issues, designing an interrupt mechanism for user interaction, and laying the groundwork for future development. This prototype served as a valuable proof-of-concept before the strategic pivot to a more dynamic tech stack.

## Phase 1: Migration & Core Architecture (Early July 2025)

### 2025-07-02: Technology Stack Migration to TypeScript & LangGraph

-   **Milestone:** Successfully migrated the project from Go to a TypeScript-based monorepo.
-   **Details:** Initialized the project with `npm` and integrated core dependencies, including `langchain` and `langgraph`, marking a fundamental shift in the project's technical direction.

### 2025-07-02: Dynamic Tool Integration Architecture

-   **Milestone:** Architected and implemented a dynamic system for integrating MCP (Model-as-a-Service Communication Protocol) tools with the LangGraph agent.
-   **Details:**
    -   Decoupled agent logic from the communication protocol, a pattern documented in `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`.
    -   Implemented a mock `McpClientManager` and a dynamic tool generator (`src/mcp/`).
    -   Converted the application into a fully interactive command-line tool using Node.js's `readline` module.

## Phase 2: Stabilization & Feature Enhancement (Early-Mid July 2025)

### 2025-07-03: System Stabilization and UX Improvements

-   **Milestone:** Achieved a stable, feature-rich application by resolving critical bugs and enhancing the user experience.
-   **Key Fixes & Features:**
    -   **API Authentication:** Resolved a `401 Authentication Fails` error by ensuring the `apiKey` was correctly passed during model initialization (`src/agents/orchestrator.ts`).
    -   **Configuration Cleanup:** Corrected the `package.json` to align with the project's `npm` package manager.
    -   **"Typewriter" Streaming:** Implemented true "typewriter" style streaming for model responses in `src/index.ts`, significantly improving the interactive feel.
    -   **DeepSeek Reasoner Stream:** Enabled the `deepseek-reasoner` model's "thinking" process stream by correctly configuring the `reasoning: {}` parameter in `src/agents/orchestrator.ts`.

### 2025-07-04: Enhanced Reliability with Zod Validation

-   **Milestone:** Increased application robustness by integrating Zod for schema validation.
-   **Details:** Implemented strict input, tool call, and output state validation within the Orchestrator agent, catching potential data errors early without compromising existing functionality.

## Phase 3: Advanced Agent Capabilities (Mid July 2025)

### 2025-07-04: Interactive Multi-Turn Conversations

-   **Milestone:** Re-architected the core graph (`src/graph.ts`) to support interactive, multi-turn conversations with specialist agents.
-   **Architectural Shift:**
    -   Moved from a rigid, single-action dispatch model to a flexible "interactive subgraph" pattern.
    -   Agents now manage their own internal state and use conditional routing to decide whether to continue a conversation or return control to the orchestrator.
-   **Impact:** This major enhancement allows the system to handle complex, multi-step tasks that require follow-up questions and user clarification, making the agents significantly more capable and autonomous.

### 2025-07-07: Dynamic Command Path Resolution Implementation

-   **Milestone:** Replaced hardcoded executable paths with dynamic resolution
-   **Details:**
    -   Created `resolveCommandPath` utility in `src/utils/command.ts` for cross-platform executable discovery
    -   Integrated path resolution in `McpClientManager` to dynamically locate `uvx`/`npx` binaries
    -   Added comprehensive test cases in `tests/mcp/mcp-client.test.ts`
-   **Benefits:**
    -   Eliminates environment-specific hardcoding
    -   Enhances cross-platform compatibility
    -   Simplifies deployment and configuration

### 2025-07-07: Advanced Debugging & Architectural Refinement

-   **Milestone:** Successfully resolved a persistent `TypeError` in the `ToolNode` and identified a key architectural improvement opportunity.
-   **Details:**
    -   After an initial fix proved insufficient, a second, more in-depth `error-debugger` sub-task was dispatched.
    -   The investigation revealed the root cause was not just a missing `tool_calls` array, but a more fundamental issue in how the final `AIMessage` was being constructed and passed within the LangGraph state.
    -   The `TypeError` was definitively fixed by refactoring `src/graph.ts` and `src/agents/orchestrator.ts` to ensure a correctly instantiated `AIMessage` is always passed to the `ToolNode`.
    -   Crucially, the debugging process also uncovered that the `Orchestrator` was overburdened with both high-level routing and low-level parameter parsing, leading to tool argument errors.
-   **Impact & Next Steps:**
    -   The system is now stable and free from the critical `TypeError` crash.
    -   A major architectural decision was made to introduce a dedicated **Parameter Parsing Agent** in the future. This will decouple responsibilities, making the system more robust and scalable. The `Orchestrator`'s prompt has been simplified in preparation for this change.

### 2025-07-07: Implementation of the Parameter Parser Agent

-   **Milestone:** Created the first version of the `ParserAgent` (`src/agents/parser.ts`), a specialized agent dedicated to converting natural language into precise JSON tool parameters.
-   **Details:**
    -   A `code-developer` sub-task was dispatched to implement the agent.
    -   The agent is built using a flexible factory function (`createParserAgent`) and leverages LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) for a clean, chainable workflow.
    -   It utilizes the `gpt-4.1-mini` model, as requested, for high-accuracy parameter extraction based on a custom-designed system prompt.
-   **Impact:** This new agent is the first concrete step in realizing our new, more robust architecture. It successfully decouples parameter parsing from the `Orchestrator`, laying the groundwork for the next phase of graph integration.

### 2025-07-07: Full Integration of the New Agent Architecture

-   **Milestone:** Successfully integrated the `ParserAgent` into the main LangGraph workflow, completing our new two-step agent architecture.
-   **Details:**
    -   A `code-developer` sub-task was dispatched to perform the integration.
    -   The `AgentState` was updated with a `next_tool` field to pass tool-calling intent.
    -   The `Orchestrator` was refactored to only be responsible for setting `next_tool`.
    -   The core graph in `src/graph.ts` was re-architected to include a new `parser` node and establish the `Orchestrator -> Parser -> ToolNode` execution path.
-   **Impact:** The project's architecture is now fundamentally more robust, modular, and scalable. The clear separation of concerns between task orchestration and parameter parsing resolves previous bugs and provides a solid foundation for future feature development.
